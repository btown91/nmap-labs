# üìÑ Nmap OS Detection Scan
# Target: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
# Command: sudo nmap -O 127.0.0.1
# Date: July 10, 2025

# üîç Description:
# This scan attempts to detect the **operating system** running on the target machine using TCP/IP fingerprinting.

# üß† Purpose:
# - Determine what OS (and kernel version) is running
# - Useful for vulnerability assessment and network inventory
# - Helps security analysts identify systems that may need patching

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
# This scan **requires root/sudo privileges** to work correctly.

# üñ•Ô∏è Output:

# ‚úÖ Summary:
- Detected device is running **Linux**
- Kernel version likely falls between **2.6.32 and 6.2**
- Only open port is **631/tcp** (CUPS printing service)
- Host is **0 hops away**, meaning it's the same device (your own machine)
