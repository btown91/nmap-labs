# üìÑ Nmap Default Script + Version Detection Scan
# Target: 127.0.0.1 (localhost)
# Command: nmap -sV --script=default 127.0.0.1
# Date: July 10, 2025

# üîç Description:
This scan combines:
- `-sV`: Service version detection
- `--script=default`: Runs a set of default NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts based on the detected open services

# üß† Purpose:
- Identify services and their versions
- Automatically run appropriate scripts (e.g. SSL cert analysis, HTTP titles, headers)
- Gather banner info, metadata, and quick security insight

Nmap picks scripts intelligently based on the **open ports and services** it sees. In this case, it recognized a CUPS (printing) service and ran HTTP-based scripts.

# üñ•Ô∏è Output:
